# Libraries Required : 
	-hashlib
	-heapq
	-numpy
	-random
	-graphviz
# Compilation Of Code:
	- Initialize the inut.txt file :
            # Do not delete lines starting with Hash 
            # Input file for simulator.
            # Next line consist of N, z0, z1, T0(Termination Time), AttackMode(0/1/2), HashingPower, Î¶ (an adversary is connected to).
			10 50 35 1000 1 25 25
			# Next line consist of Tmean.
			10 
			# Next line consist of Kmean.
			30
	- to compile the code do the following:
		-- install prerequisite libraries 
		-- Run mainfile.py
		-- Attack Mode 
			- 0 (No Attack)
			- 1 (Selfish Mining Attack)
			- 2 (Stubborn)

# Output:
	- Output is generated and saved in results.
	- output for point 8 will be generated in folder
		-- each file for a node contains <block hash: time> pair
