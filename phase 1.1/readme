# Libraries Required : 
	-hashlib
	-heapq
	-numpy
	-random
	-graphviz
# Compilation Of Code:
	- Initialize the inut.txt file :
            # Do not delete lines starting with Hash 
            # Input file for simulator.
            # Next line consist of N z0 z1 T0(Termination Time) respectively seperated by spaces.
            10 50 40 20000
            # Next line consist of Tmean for each node seperated by spaces.
            10 20 25 22 34 38 32 13 13 27
            # Next line consist of Kmean for each node seperated by spaces.
            100 250 300 200 480 500 200 661 500 900
	- to compile the code do the following:
		-- install prerequisite libraries 
		-- Run mainfile.py
# Output:
	- Output is generated and saved in results.
	- output for point 8 will be generated in folder
		-- each file for a node contains <block hash: time> pair
